Adammantium Multiplayer Mod is a simple Multiplayer Mod for Blade &amp; Sorcery U12.

**Disclaimer: This mod is only a proof of concept atm and buggy as hell. It works, but it's in no way polished.
For more information or help, just give us a visit on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TdMy59ccfC).**

I never intended the mod to go this far, but well, here we go.

## [Mod itself](https://github.com/AdammantiumMultiplayer/AMP)
This is the code of the mod itself.
## [Discord Bot](https://github.com/AdammantiumMultiplayer/Discord-Hosting-Bot)
This bot is what i use to make it possible to host a bot by using a discord command.
## [Server Code](https://github.com/AdammantiumMultiplayer/Server)
Dedicated server that allows a server to run without the game itself. Perfect for a custom server.
This also allows for the use of plugins. So have fun!
